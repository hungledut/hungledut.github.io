4.Phương pháp đọc và tiếp cận việc viết báo
======

### Xác định loại làm nghiên cứu

* Nghiên cứu cái đã có
* Đề xuất giải pháp mới
* Kết hợp nhiều phương pháp với nhau

### Câu hỏi nghiên cứu

* Xác định vấn đề nghiên cứu
* tìm và đọc các bài báo liên quan đến câu hỏi nghiên cứu

### Cách đọc một paper

* survey và overview (đọc từ mới đến cũ)
* research cụ thể một vấn đề (giải pháp cụ thể) thì nên đọc (từ cũ đến mới)

### Khi đọc bài báo thì làm gì?

* Note các đoạn văn, tham khảo để viết lại mới.
* Đọc và hiểu abstract cho lượt đầu, nhưng absstract thì viết cuối cùng.
* Đọc background cơ bản
* Cuối phần introduction sẽ có phần nói tác giả sẽ làm gì trong bài báo và đóng góp gì? hiểu hơn về câu hỏi nghiên cứu của họ?
* Related work: chỉ ra nghiên cứu nào liên quan đến bài báo hiện tại –> liệt kê các vấn đề trước đó –> đọc phần related word để hiểu được câu hỏi “research question”

### Một ví dụ về việc viết báo

* Cách viết introduction: liệt kê vấn đề xung quanh keywords, giải thích các vấn đề, mỗi vấn đề sẽ có những đóng góp liên quan
* Viết related work: tham khảo phần cuối introduction của các bài báo khác? note lại cách viết của các bài báo họ đã làm? kết quả của họ là gì? thiếu sót cái gì?
* Phần methods: dataset gì? cách xử lý dữ liệu thế nào? họ dùng phương pháp nào cho thực nghiệm? luồng thực hiện ra sao?
* Phần thực nghiệm: thời gian, độ chính xác, mô tả kết quả, phân tích kết quả và cuối cùng là giải thích kết quả. Cách họ improve model hoặc fine tuning model ra sao?
* Phần kết luận: đóng góp chính bài báo là gì? Công việc tương lai sẽ làm gì?
* Viết abstract: Nó được viết cuối cùng? giới thiệu phương pháp và kết quả thực hiện.

5.Tư duy để liệt kê danh sách các bài toán nghiên cứu cụ thể
======

### Về nguyên tắc để liệt kê các bài báo cần viết

* Trước hết, cần phải có một luồng làm việc phù hợp với chủ đề của mình.
* Tiếp theo, phát thảo chi tiết của luồng đã có. Ví dụ như input là gì? Process gồm những phần nào? Và Output gồm những phần nào?
* Sau đó, với mỗi phần mình sẽ định hình những kỹ thuật nào sẽ dùng và dùng thế nào?
* Nên: Tìm các phương pháp cho từng process nhỏ (process1 thì dùng kỹ thuật 1, process2 thì dùng kỹ thuật 2,…)
* Tiếp đến, tìm cách để optimize có thể là fine tuning hoặc các thuật toán tối ưu hoặc heuristics.
* Cái quan trọng: Vẽ được luồng tổng quan hoạt động để làm việc.
* Cuối cùng sẽ tách nhỏ ra: Bài toán 1 thì làm ở chỗ process1, Bài toán 2 thì nên làm ở process2.
* Tùy vào phạm vi của bài toán mà có thể xác định submit ở conf hoặc journal hoặc ranking phù hợp.

### Về nguyên tắc viết báo

* Sử dụng công cụ hỗ trợ
* Xác định từng outline tương ứng cho từng bài toán cụ thể
* Ở mỗi outline, xác định từng phần nhỏ nhỏ, để viết làm sao người đọc vào có thể hiểu ngay được.
* Chia nhỏ từng phần cho dễ đọc và dễ focus hơn. Lúc này bài trình bày sẽ rõ ràng hơn rất nhiều.


6.Việc hướng dẫn sinh viên để tham gia nckh
======

Cần xác định một số nội dung sau:

* tài liệu tham khảo
* viết review (abstract hay liệt kê các method)
* cài đặt, so sánh
* các contribution (có thể fe, preprocessing, …, chia nhỏ, pretrained)
* viết nháp theo format (latex) và trình bày slide

Viết báo thì cần lưu ý và nhớ rằng:

* Cần phải có nội dung, sau đó mới có bảng hoặc hình ảnh xuất hiện ở phía dưới. (rat quan trong)
* Dùng pdf lưu ảnh để load file dữ liệu
* Thảo luận về kết quả chủ yếu mô tả và không phân tích sâu hoặc giải thích kết quả. Hơn nữa, thiếu hỗ trợ trực quan để minh họa kết quả. —> giải thích sâu hơn về kết quả, giải thích tại sao chúng xảy ra và ý nghĩa của chúng trong ngữ cảnh của mục tiêu nghiên cứu.


7.Cách viết các bài analysis và survey "nhẹ nhàng" thì làm thế nào? 
======

5. **Quality Assessment:** Assess the quality of included studies to ensure the reliability of the evidence.
6. **Data Synthesis:** Summarize and synthesize the findings from selected studies, often using statistical methods to analyze the data.
7. **Report Writing:** Present the systematic review findings in a structured and transparent manner, highlighting key conclusions and implications.


Literature Review:

**Concept:**
A literature review is a broader and more general survey of existing literature on a particular topic. 
It involves the identification, evaluation, and synthesis of published information, including books, articles, and other scholarly sources. 
While a literature review can be systematic, it often lacks the structured methodology and exhaustive search strategy associated with a systematic review.

**Description:**
1. **Overview of Existing Knowledge:** A literature review provides an overview of the existing knowledge and research on a given topic.
2. **Scope and Coverage:** It encompasses a wide range of sources, including books, articles, conference proceedings, and other relevant publications.
3. **Narrative Synthesis:** Unlike systematic reviews, literature reviews often involve a narrative synthesis of the available literature without the strict methodology and statistical analysis used in systematic reviews.
4. **Varied Objectives:** Literature reviews can serve different purposes, such as providing historical context, identifying gaps in the literature, or presenting diverse perspectives on a topic.

**How it's done:**
1. **Define Scope:** Clearly define the scope and objectives of the literature review.
2. **Search and Selection:** Conduct a literature search using various sources to identify relevant studies and publications.
3. **Critical Evaluation:** Evaluate the quality and relevance of the selected literature, considering factors like methodology and credibility.
4. **Synthesis:** Summarize and synthesize key findings, themes, or trends from the literature to provide a comprehensive overview.
5. **Identification of Gaps:** Identify gaps or areas where further research is needed.
6. **Organization and Presentation:** Present the literature review in a well-organized manner, often following a thematic or chronological structure.


**Difference between Systematic Review and Literature Review:**

1. **Methodology:**
   - **Systematic Review:** Follows a structured and rigorous methodology with predefined protocols, systematic search strategies, and often includes statistical analysis.
   - **Literature Review:** May lack a strict methodology and often involves a narrative synthesis of existing literature.

2. **Inclusion Criteria:**
   - **Systematic Review:** Inclusion and exclusion criteria are explicitly defined to select studies based on specific characteristics.
   - **Literature Review:** Inclusion criteria may be less defined, allowing for a broader range of sources.

3. **Scope:**
   - **Systematic Review:** Focused on answering a specific research question using a comprehensive and systematic approach.
   - **Literature Review:** Provides a broader overview of existing literature on a topic without a specific research question.

4. **Synthesis of Findings:**
   - **Systematic Review:** Involves a thorough analysis of data from selected studies, often using statistical methods.
   - **Literature Review:** Synthesizes findings in a narrative manner, presenting an overview of the existing literature.

5. **Purpose:**
   - **Systematic Review:** Aims to answer a specific research question by synthesizing high-quality evidence.
   - **Literature Review:** May serve various purposes, including providing background information, identifying gaps, or offering a broad understanding of a topic.

In summary, while both systematic reviews and literature reviews involve a review of existing literature, they differ in terms of methodology, scope, and the specific objectives they aim to achieve. 
Systematic reviews are more structured and focused, while literature reviews are often broader and more narrative in nature.

16.How to build mathematical formula (from natural idea)
======

prompt:
As you are an optimization expert, now I have an idea, I want you to express that idea in a mathematical formula.

Given N cells at ground level, with K beams at satellite. I want to write an optimization function to minimize the energy needed to transmit at each beam, knowing that the traffic demand at each cell N_i is different. The total energy of the beams does not exceed P.



How you can represent your optimization problem idea with formulas, constraints, and potential implementation:

Formulas:

Objective Function: This formula represents the quantity you want to optimize, either maximize (profit) or minimize (cost). It will involve your variables and mathematical operations.

Variable Definitions: Define each variable used in the objective function and any other relevant formulas. Specify their units if applicable.

Constraints:

These formulas represent limitations or restrictions on your variables. They ensure your solution makes sense in the real world. Constraints can be expressed as:

Equality Constraints: These enforce an exact relationship between variables (e.g., total resources = used resources + remaining resources).
Inequality Constraints: These specify limitations or boundaries for variables (e.g., production time cannot be negative).
Implementation:

Here are some ways to implement your optimization problem depending on its complexity:

Manual Calculation: For simple problems, you can directly solve the formulas and constraints to find the optimal solution.
Spreadsheet Software: Spreadsheets like Excel can be used to set up your objective function and constraints as formulas in cells. You can then use built-in solver functions to find the optimal values for your variables.
Optimization Software: For more complex problems, specialized optimization software exists (e.g., LINGO, Gurobi). These can handle a wider range of functions, constraints, and variable types.

Let's say you want to optimize the production of two products (A and B) to maximize profit.

Formulas:
Objective Function (Profit): Profit = (Price_A * Units_A) + (Price_B * Units_B)
Variable Definitions: Units_A (number of product A units), Units_B (number of product B units), Price_A (price per unit A), Price_B (price per unit B)
Constraints:
Resource Constraint (limited material): Material_A * Units_A + Material_B * Units_B <= Total_Material (inequality)
Production Time Constraint (limited time): Time_A * Units_A + Time_B * Units_B <= Total_Production_Time (inequality)
Implementation:
You can solve this manually for small problems.
Use a spreadsheet with formulas in each cell and the solver function to find the optimal production levels for A and B that maximize profit within the constraints.
For larger problems with many variables and constraints, consider using optimization software.
