Hiểu hơn về các thuật toán phổ biến cần phải biết và sử dụng


𝟭𝟬 𝗔𝗹𝗴𝗼𝗿𝗶𝘁𝗵𝗺𝘀 𝗘𝘃𝗲𝗿𝘆 𝗘𝗻𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗿 𝗦𝗵𝗼𝘂𝗹𝗱 𝗞𝗻𝗼𝘄:


𝟬.💡 𝗕𝗿𝗲𝗮𝗱𝘁𝗵-𝗙𝗶𝗿𝘀𝘁 𝗦𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗰𝗵 (𝗕𝗙𝗦): 
Explore a graph level by level, starting from the root, which is great for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs. 
➡️ Useful when: You're designing web crawlers or analyzing social networks.

𝟭.💡 𝗧𝘄𝗼 𝗛𝗲𝗮𝗽𝘀: 
Uses a min-heap and max-heap to manage dynamic datasets efficiently, maintaining median and priority. 
➡️ Useful when: You need to manage a priority queue or dynamic datasets.

𝟮.💡 𝗧𝘄𝗼 𝗣𝗼𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀: 
This technique takes 2 points in a sequence and performs logic based on the problem.
➡️ Useful when: You are implementing sorting or searching functions.

𝟯.💡 𝗦𝗹𝗶𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗪𝗶𝗻𝗱𝗼𝘄: 
Optimizes the computation by reusing the state from the previous subset of data. 
➡️ Useful when: You're handling network congestion or data compression.

𝟰.💡 𝗗𝗲𝗽𝘁𝗵-𝗙𝗶𝗿𝘀𝘁 𝗦𝗲𝗮𝗿𝗰𝗵 (𝗗𝗙𝗦): 
Explores each path to the end, ideal for situations that involve exploring all options like in puzzles. 
➡️ Useful when: You're working with graph structures or need to generate permutations.

𝟱.💡 𝗧𝗼𝗽𝗼𝗹𝗼𝗴𝗶𝗰𝗮𝗹 𝗦𝗼𝗿𝘁: 
Helps in scheduling tasks based on their dependencies. 
➡️ Useful when: You are determining execution order in project management or compiling algorithms.

𝟲.💡 𝗠𝗲𝗿𝗴𝗲 𝗜𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗮𝗹𝘀: 
Optimizes overlapping intervals to minimize the number of intervals. 
➡️ Useful when: Scheduling resources or managing calendars.

𝟳.💡 𝗕𝗮𝗰𝗸𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗰𝗸𝗶𝗻𝗴: 
It explores all potential solutions systematically and is perfect for solving puzzles and optimization problems. 
➡️ Useful when: Solving complex logical puzzles or optimizing resource allocations.

𝟴.💡 𝗧𝗿𝗶𝗲 (𝗣𝗿𝗲𝗳𝗶𝘅 𝗧𝗿𝗲𝗲): 
A tree-like structure that manages dynamic sets of strings efficiently, often used for searching. 
➡️ Useful when: Implementing spell-checkers or autocomplete systems.

𝟵.💡 𝗙𝗹𝗼𝗼𝗱 𝗙𝗶𝗹𝗹: 
It fills a contiguous area for features like the 'paint bucket' tool. 
➡️ Useful when: Working in graphics editors or game development.

𝟭𝟬.💡 𝗦𝗲𝗴𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 𝗧𝗿𝗲𝗲: 
Efficiently manages intervals or segments and is useful for storing information about intervals and querying over them. 
➡️ Useful when: Dealing with database range queries or statistical calculations.


Hết.
